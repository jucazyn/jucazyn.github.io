In a highly specialized world, I've always been driven by the challenge of connecting not only distinct fields but also foundations with applications. This led me to an interdisciplinary education. 

I'm a Philosophy student at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics (UFSC, 2023). At present, I'm investigating when and why two physical theories could be considered **equivalent**, and how this helps the broader debate about the nature of scientific theories. The research is conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0).

As an aspiring [mathematical philosopher](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/meta.12029), I have in my utility belt the tools to tackle cutting-edge research and industry problems, being able to use sophisticated mathematical methods, make rigorous conceptual analysis, and --- of great importance --- translate these theoretical frameworks into applicable features.

**I'm open to part-time, remote opportunities**. My cv can be found [here](https://jucazyn.github.io/cv/). Feel free to contact me.

## main interests

My foundational and applied interests lie in the following areas:

**Logic.** The Logic-related topics that I'm interested are Categorical Logic and dualities, such as the so-called Stone-type dualities (e.g., Stone, Gelfand), other algebro-geometric dualities, and their applications.

**Philosophy of Science.** My main philosophical area of research. I focus on the history and nuances of the debate on the logical foundations of scientific theories, covering topics such as the Vienna Circle's received view, the linguistic _vs_. model-theoretic views of theories debate, the relation between Philosophy of Science and scientific practice, and theoretical equivalence.

**Foundations of Physics.** In this interdisciplinary field, I combine Mathematical Physics, History of Physics, and Philosophy of Physics, to conduct mathematical and philosophical inquiry into physical theories.

**Artificial Intelligence.** Here, my goal is to translate academic stuff into practical and accessible things by clarifying mathematical and conceptual aspects of Machine Learning and its applications, as well as developing research in the Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence to help make sense of a world increasingly shaped by Artificial Intelligence.
