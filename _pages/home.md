In a highly specialized world, I've always been driven by the challenge of connecting not only distinct theoretical fields but also theory and applications. This led me to an interdisciplinary education. Currently, I'm a student in Philosophy at UFSC, who holds a bachelor's degree in Mathematics (UFSC, 2023) and work under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0).

As an aspiring [mathematical philosopher](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/meta.12029), my training allows me to approach cutting-edge research or industry problemas that require both sophisticated mathematical methods, rigorous conceptual analysis and, of great importance, translate all this into applicable tools.

**I'm open to part-time, remote opportunities**. My cv can be found [here](https://jucazyn.github.io/cv/). Feel free to contact me.

## main research areas

My research interests lie in the following areas:

**Foundations of Physics.** logico-philosophical investigations of physical theories...

**Philosophy of Science.** syntax-semantics debate, equivalence of scientific theories...

**Dualities.** Stone-type dualities, other algebro-geometric dualities and applications;

**Artificial Intelligence.** ...
