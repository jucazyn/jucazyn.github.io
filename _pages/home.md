I'm an aspiring Mathematical Philosopher concerned about Physics and Technology. In more words, I'm interested in addressing foundational and applied problems that emerge from these areas by employing both mathematical and philosophical methods. This approach is often referred to as [Mathematical Philosophy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/meta.12029).

My background combines Mathematics, Philosophy, and Physics, bridging the gap beetwen **logical foundations** and **modern applications**. This interdisciplinary training uniquely positions me to tackle deep conceptual and complex practical problems such as those on the frontiers of science and industry --- from unification in Physics to foundational and applied problems in Artificial Intelligence.

My academic work mainly center around Logic, Philosophy of Science and Physics, with a substantial part of it notably lying at the intersection of Mathematical Physics and Philosophy of Physics. Specifically, I'm studying the notions of **equivalence**, **reduction** and **unification** of physical theories under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0). In addition, we're examining the connection between these notions and the so-called **syntax-semantics debate**.

In 2026, I'll begin my master's degree, continuing my research on physical theories. Alongside my academic goals for next year, I'm also open to part-time, remote opportunities in Artificial Intelligence. If you believe my profile aligns with the needs of your team or projects, I would welcome the opportunity to connect. Please feel free to email me.

## technical skills

My technical proficiency includes:

* **Theoretical:** Category Theory, Functional Analysis and Probability Theory;
* **Applied/computational:** Quantum Computing, Machine Learning and Python.

## research interests

My research interests lie in the following topics:

* **Foundations of Physics:** logico-philosophical investigations of physical theories;
* **Philosophy of Science:** syntax-semantics debate, equivalence of scientific theories;
* **Operator Algebras:** Stone-type dualities, C*-algebras and algebraic quantum logic;
* **Artificial Intelligence:** _coming soon_.
