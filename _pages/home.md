I'm a [mathematical philosopher](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/meta.12029) concerned with the foundations of science and technology. At present, I'm investigating when and why two physical theories could be considered **equivalent**, and how this helps the broader debate about the nature of scientific theories. The research is conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0).

My academic background combines a bachelor's degree in Mathematics (UFSC, 2023) with ongoing studies in Philosophy at UFSC. I have been awarded four [PIBIC/CNPq undergraduate research fellowships](https://pibic.ufsc.br/), between 2021 and 2025, and am an incoming master's student in Philosophy, also at UFSC, starting in 2026.

## outside academia

Along with my academic activities, I'm also an aspiring data scientist, open to part-time, internship or junior opportunities in Data Science during mornings (BRT). My industry-oriented cv can be found [here](https://jucazyn.github.io/files/cv.pdf). Further, whenever possible, [I get involved in projects](https://www.instagram.com/p/BM7lKcsArOW/) aimed at disseminating science, to a general audience, with a philosophical twist. I'm particularly passionate about teaching Category Theory.
