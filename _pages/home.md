In a highly specialized world, I've always been driven by the challenge of connecting not only distinct fields but also foundations with applications. This led me to an interdisciplinary education. 

I'm a Philosophy student at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics (UFSC, 2023). At present, I'm investigating when and why two physical theories could be considered **equivalent**, and how this helps the broader debate about the nature of scientific theories. The research is conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0).

As an aspiring [mathematical philosopher](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/meta.12029), I have in my utility belt the tools to tackle cutting-edge research and industry problems, being able to use sophisticated mathematical methods, make rigorous conceptual analysis, and --- of great importance --- translate these theoretical frameworks into applicable features.

**I'm open to part-time, remote opportunities**. My cv can be found [here](https://jucazyn.github.io/cv/). Feel free to contact me.

## main interests

**Logic.** The Logic-related topics that I'm interested are Categorical Logic and dualities, such as the so-called Stone-type dualities (e.g., Stone, Gelfand) and other algebro-geometric dualities.

**Philosophy of Science.** My main philosophical area of research. I focus on the history and nuances of the debate on the logical foundations of scientific theories, covering topics such as the Vienna Circle's received view, the linguistic _vs_. model-theoretic views of theories debate, the relation between Philosophy of Science and scientific practice, and theoretical equivalence.

**Foundations of Physics.** In this interdisciplinary field, I combine Mathematical Physics, History of Physics, and Philosophy of Physics, to conduct mathematical and philosophical inquiry into physical theories.

**Quantum Physics.** Lastly, in this big topic my goal is twofold: to explore its foundations and to translate the foundational advances into applications. About the first, I've been studying the mathematical foundations of (Algebraic) Quantum Mechanics, i.e., C*-algebras, operator-theoretic aspects of the quantum formalism, the algebraic approach to Quantum Logic, and so on. At the same time, I took many "quantum courses", namely Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Chemistry, Quantum Computing and Quantum Information, with that second point in mind, preparing myself to work on the frontiers of quantum research in the future, searching for new technologies through mathematical and conceptual advances in the foundations.
