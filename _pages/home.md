I'm a Philosophy student at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics (UFSC, 2023). At present, I'm investigating when and why two physical theories could be considered **equivalent**, and how this helps the broader debate about the nature of scientific theories. The research is conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0).

**I'm open to part-time opportunities**. My cv can be found [here](https://jucazyn.github.io/cv/). Feel free to contact me.

## style & research

Trained both as mathematician and philosopher, I'm interested in exploring problems of philosophical nature where mathematical methods can provide some insight; an approach called [Mathematical Philosophy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/meta.12029). Among the mathematical methods I use most, Category Theory stands out.

My research interests mainly center around **Logic**, **Philosophy of Science** and **Philosophy of Technology**, including foundational science and technology problems. Specifically, I'm interested in the philosophical and mathematical foundations of Physics and Artificial Intelligence.

## outside academia

Along to my academic activities, I'm also an aspiring data scientist interested in social causes.
