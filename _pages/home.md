I'm a Philosophy student at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics (UFSC, 2023). At present, I'm investigating when and why two physical theories could be considered **equivalent**, and how this helps the broader debate about the nature of scientific theories. The research is conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0).

**I'm open to part-time opportunities**. My cv can be found [here](https://jucazyn.github.io/cv/). Feel free to contact me.

## research interests

I'm trained as a mathematical philosopher, i.e., I'm interested in exploring problems of philosophical nature where mathematical methods are needed. The philosophical topics that I'm interested mainly center around Philosophy of Science and Philosophy of Technology, but I'm also interested in foundational science and technology problems. Specifically, I'm interested in the philosophical and mathematical foundations of Physics and Artificial Intelligence.
