I'm a Philosophy student at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics (UFSC, 2023). At present, I'm investigating when and why two physical theories could be considered **equivalent**, and how this helps the broader debate about the nature of scientific theories. The research is conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0).

**I'm open to part-time opportunities**. My cv can be found [here](https://jucazyn.github.io/cv/). Feel free to contact me.

## style and research

Trained both as a mathematician and a philosopher, I'm interested in exploring problems of _philosophical nature_ where _mathematical methods can provide some insight_. This approach is sometimes referred to as [Mathematical Philosophy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/meta.12029). Among the mathematical methods I use most, [Category Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory) stands out.

My research interests mainly center around Logic, Philosophy of Science and, more recently, Philosophy of Technology, including foundational science and technology problems. Specifically, I'm interested in the philosophical and mathematical foundations of Physics and Artificial Intelligence.

## outside academia

Along with my academic activities, I'm also an aspiring data scientist interested in social issues.
