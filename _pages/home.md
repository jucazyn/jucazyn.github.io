I'm a Philosophy student at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) who holds a bachelor's degree in Mathematics (UFSC, 2023).

As an aspiring [mathematical philosopher](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/meta.12029), I'm training to approach problems that interest me from these fields employing both mathematical and philosophical methods. 
 
The guiding thread of my work is the study of **equivalence** --- the central question of when different things can be understood as the same. Currently, I'm studying logical foundations of scientific theories under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0). We're investigating the notions of equivalence between physical theories and their relations to the broader **syntax-semantics debate** about the nature of scientific theories.

**I'm open to part-time, remote opportunities**. My cv can be found [here](https://jucazyn.github.io/cv/). Feel free to contact me.

## main research areas

My research interests lie in the following areas:

**Foundations of Physics.** logico-philosophical investigations of physical theories...

**Philosophy of Science.** syntax-semantics debate, equivalence of scientific theories...

**Dualities.** Stone-type dualities, other algebro-geometric dualities and applications;

**Artificial Intelligence.** ...
