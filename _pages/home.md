I'm an undergraduate student in Philosophy at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics (UFSC, 2023). 

My research interests mainly center around Logic, Philosophy of Science and Physics, with a substantial part of it notably lying at the intersection of **Mathematical Physics** and **Philosophy of Physics**.

In general, I'm interested in (how to) address some philosophical problems, and scientific problems featuring foundational aspects, employing both mathematical methods and philosophical methods. This approach is sometimes referred to as [Mathematical Philosophy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/meta.12029).

Specifically, I'm studying the notions of **equivalence**, **reduction** and **unification** of physical theories under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0). In addition, we're examining the connection between these notions and the so-called **syntax-semantics debate**.

In summary, one can say I'm interested in the **Foundations of Science** with special emphasis in the physical sciences.

## Research interests

My research interests lie in the following topics:

* **Foundations of Physics:** logical/philosophical investigations of physical theories;
* **Philosophy of Science:** syntax-semantics debate, equivalence of scientific theories;
* **Operator Algebras:** C*-algebras, mathematical foundations of Quantum Mechanics;
* **Dualities:** Stone-type dualities and other bridges between Algebra and Geometry.
