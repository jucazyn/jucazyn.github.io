I'm a [mathematical philosopher](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/meta.12029) working on **Logic**, **Philosophy of Science** and **Foundations of Physics**. At present, I’m investigating the criteria for theoretical equivalence in Physics, as well as the implications of this for the classical debate on the nature of scientific theories. The research is conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0).

My academic background combines a bachelor's degree in Mathematics (UFSC, 2023) with ongoing studies in Philosophy at UFSC. I have been awarded four [PIBIC/CNPq undergraduate research fellowships](https://pibic-ufsc-br.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=pt&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp), from 2021 to 2025, and am an incoming master's student in Philosophy, starting next year.

## outside academia

I'm also committed to education and social causes. Viewing teaching as a way of giving back to the community, whenever possible, [I engage in projects](https://www.instagram.com/p/BM7lKcsArOW/) aimed at disseminating science to a general audience through a philosophical lens. I'm particularly enthusiastic about using [Category Theory](https://youtu.be/eXBwU9ieLL0) as a pedagogical tool, empowering students to structure their understanding of Mathematics from very early.
