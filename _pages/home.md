I'm a [mathematical philosopher](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/meta.12029), exploring questions related to _theories_, _models_ and _data_. At present, I'm investigating when and why two theories could be considered equivalent, and the implications of this for the classical debate about the nature of scientific theories. The research is conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0).

My academic background combines a bachelor's degree in Mathematics (UFSC, 2023) with ongoing studies in Philosophy at UFSC. I have been awarded four [PIBIC/CNPq undergraduate research fellowships](https://pibic-ufsc-br.translate.goog/?_x_tr_sl=pt&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp), from 2021 to 2025, and am an incoming master's student in Philosophy, starting next year.

## outside academia

Along with my academic activities, I'm also an aspiring data scientist, open to part-time, internship or junior opportunities in Data Science during mornings (BRT). My industry-oriented cv can be found [here](https://jucazyn.github.io/files/cv.pdf). 

I'm also committed to education and social causes. Viewing teaching as a way of giving back to the community, whenever possible, [I engage in projects](https://www.instagram.com/p/BM7lKcsArOW/) aimed at disseminating science to a general audience through a philosophical lens. I'm particularly enthusiastic about using Category Theory as a pedagogical tool, empowering students to structure their understanding of Mathematics from very early.
