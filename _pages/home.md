I'm an aspiring **mathematical philosopher** focused on Logic, Philosophy of Science and Physics. In more words, I'm interested in addressing foundational and applied problems that emerge from these areas by employing both mathematical and philosophical methods. This approach is often referred to as [Mathematical Philosophy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/meta.12029).

The guiding thread of my research is the study of **equivalences** and **dualities**. My interest centers on how different things can be viewed, in some sense, as "the same" --- something with profound theoretical and practical implications. In Mathematics, for example, this manifest as certain algebras and spaces being dual of each other. The relevance of this extends across a broad spectrum, from the foundations of Logic and Quantum Physics to the frontiers of Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence.

Nowadays, one of the best formal tools for mathematically approaching the question about when two things are the same is **Category Theory**, a metamathematical framework for comparing mathematical theories. And one of the main tools I _enthusiastically_ use. Using Category Theory, the notion of equivalence and duality can be formalized in a very useful way and it can be shown that Syntax and Semantics are dual of each other, a consequence of an important theorem called [Stone duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_duality).

In my current research, conducted at the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0) under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR), I'm studying the (possible) notions of equivalence of physical theories and we're examining the connection between those notions and the **syntax-semantics debate** about the nature of scientific theories.

In 2026, I'll begin my master's degree, continuing my research on physical theories. Alongside my academic goals for next year, I'm also _open to part-time, remote opportunities_. My curriculum can be found [here](https://jucazyn.github.io/cv/). If my profile aligns with the needs of your team or projects, please feel free to contact me.
