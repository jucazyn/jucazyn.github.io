I'm a Philosophy student at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) who hold a bachelor's degree in Mathematics (UFSC, 2023) and is focused mainly in Logic, Philosophy of Science and Physics. A notably part of my research interests lie at the intersection of **Mathematical Physics** and **Philosophy of Physics**. As an aspiring [mathematical philosopher](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/meta.12029), I'm interested in addressing foundational and applied problems that emerge from this areas employing both mathematical and philosophical methods.
 
The guiding thread of my work is the study of **equivalence** --- the central question of when different things can be understood as the same. Currently, I'm studying logical foundations of scientific theories under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0). We're investigating the notions of equivalence between physical theories and their relations to the broader **syntax-semantics debate** about the nature of scientific theories.

I'm also open to part-time, remote opportunities. My curriculum can be found [here](https://jucazyn.github.io/cv/). If my profile aligns with your needs, please feel free to contact me.

## technical skills

My technical proficiency includes:

* **Theoretical:** Category Theory, Functional Analysis, Probability Theory;
* **Coding:** (entry-level) Python, (entry-level) JavaScript, HTML/CSS, LaTeX;
* **Computational:** Quantum Computing, (entry-level) Machine Learning.

## research interests

My research interests lie in the following topics:

* **Foundations of Physics:** logico-philosophical investigations of physical theories;
* **Philosophy of Science:** syntax-semantics debate, equivalence of scientific theories;
* **Dualities:** Stone-type dualities, algebro-geometric dualities and applications.
