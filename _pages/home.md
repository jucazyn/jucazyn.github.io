In a highly specialized world, I've always been driven by the challenge of connecting not only distinct fields but also foundations with applications. This led me to an interdisciplinary education. 

I'm a Philosophy student at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics (UFSC, 2023). At present, I'm investigating when and why two physical theories could be considered **equivalent**, and how this helps the broader debate about the nature of scientific theories. The research is conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0).

As an aspiring [mathematical philosopher](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/meta.12029), I have in my utility belt the tools to tackle cutting-edge research and industry problems, being able to use sophisticated mathematical methods, make rigorous conceptual analysis, and --- of great importance --- translate these theoretical frameworks into applicable features.

**I'm open to part-time, remote opportunities**. My cv can be found [here](https://jucazyn.github.io/cv/). Feel free to contact me.

## main interests

**Logic.** The Logic-related topics that I'm interested are Categorical Logic and dualities, such as the so-called Stone-type dualities (e.g., Stone, Gelfand) and other algebro-geometric dualities.

**Philosophy of Science.** My main philosophical area of research. I focus on the history and nuances of the debate on the logical foundations of scientific theories, covering topics such as the Vienna Circle's received view, the linguistic _vs_. model-theoretic views of theories debate, the relation between Philosophy of Science and scientific practice, and theoretical equivalence.

**Foundations of Physics.** In this interdisciplinary field, I combine Mathematical Physics, History of Physics, and Philosophy of Physics, to conduct mathematical and philosophical inquiry into physical theories.

**Artificial Intelligence.** I have a growing interest in applying mathematical methods to explore foundational questions around Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
