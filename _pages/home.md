I'm a mathematical philosopher concerned with the foundations of science and technology. At present, I'm investigating when and why two physical theories could be considered **equivalent**, and how this helps the broader debate about the nature of scientific theories. The research is conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0) at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/).

## outside academia

Along with my academic activities, I'm also an aspiring data scientist, open to part-timem internship or junior opportunities in Data Science during mornings (BRT). My cv can be found [here](https://jucazyn.github.io/cv).
