I'm an undergraduate student in Philosophy at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics. 

Regarding my research interests, they mainly center around Logic, Philosophy of Science and Physics. 

In general, I'm interested in (how to) address some philosophical problems, and scientific problems with foundational taste, employing both philosophical methods and logical methods (or, more broadly, mathematical methods). This approach is sometimes referred to as [Mathematical Philosophy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/meta.12029). 

Specifically, I'm studying foundations and equivalence of scientific theories.

When time permits, I blog about these things at [Fundamentae](http://fundamentae.com).

## Research interests

My research interests lie in the following topics:

* **Foundations of Physics:** logical/philosophical investigations of physical theories;
* **Philosophy of Science:** syntax-semantics debate, equivalence of scientific theories;
* **Operator Algebras:** C*-algebras, mathematical foundations of Quantum Mechanics;
* **Dualities:** Stone-type dualities and other bridges between Algebra and Geometry.

## Short CV

My education trajectory until now is:

* **B.A. in Philosophy, UFSC (2024-current)**
  * Emphasis in Philosophy of Physics
