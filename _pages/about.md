I'm a Philosophy student at [UFSC](https://ufsc.br/) with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics (UFSC, 2023). Trained both as a mathematician and a philosopher, I'm interested in exploring problems of _philosophical nature_ where _mathematical methods can provide some insight_. This approach is frequently referred to as [Mathematical Philosophy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/meta.12029). Among the mathematical methods I use most, [Category Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory) stands out.

My research interests mainly center around **Philosophy of Science** and, more recently, **Philosophy of Technology**, including foundational science and technology questions. Particularly, I'm interested in the mathematical and philosophical foundations of Physics and Artificial Intelligence.
