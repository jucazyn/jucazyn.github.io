Regarding my research interests, they mainly center around Logic, Philosophy of Science and Physics. As an aspiring [mathematical philosopher](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/meta.12029), I'm training to approach problems that interest me from these fields employing both mathematical and philosophical methods. 

A notable part of the Physics-related problems that intrigues me <span style="color: #999999;">[unsurprisingly]</span> lies at the intersection of **Mathematical Physics** and **Philosophy of Physics**. Furthermore, I've become increasingly interested in mathematical and philosophical challenges in cutting-edge **Artificial Intelligence** research.
 
The guiding thread of my work is the study of **equivalence** --- the central question of when different things can be understood as the same. Currently, I'm studying logical foundations of scientific theories under the supervision of [Prof. Jonas R. Becker Arenhart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=INalU8cAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR) in the [Research Group in Logic and Foundations of Science](https://sites.google.com/view/logicandfoundationsofscience/home?authuser=0). We're investigating the notions of equivalence between physical theories and their relations to the broader **syntax-semantics debate** about the nature of scientific theories.

Beyond academia, my highly theoretical profile expresses itself in two ways: **technology** and **writing**. On one hand, I'm enthusiastically driven by applications involving Quantum Computing or Machine Learning, especially those where category-theoretic techniques play an important role. On the other hand, I seek to articulate what I learn into materials that may one day become blog articles or books.
